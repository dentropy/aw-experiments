## TODO

I just learned about Erik's [QuantifiedMe](https://erik.bjareholt.com/quantifiedme/Dashboard.html#Today-plot) jupyter notebook. [Source](https://github.com/ErikBjare/quantifiedme/blob/master/notebooks/Dashboard.ipynb). I can't get it up and running because there are a couple different private python modules but I hope to replicate the functionality of all the graphs.

## List Graphs from QuantifiedMe

* Graph logged (durration) time per
  * Total
  * Bucket
  * App name
  * Website Domain Name
  * Hourly per Day
* Tagged Activities
  * I need my own workflow

## Reminder

* [Calendar heatmaps from Pandas time series data â€” calplot 0.1.7.4 documentation](https://calplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
